                <span class="v17_154">Key Functions:
Automated Crack Detection:
The device would automatically detect cracks and other pavement distresses using computer vision algorithms. It would analyze images captured by cameras mounted on vehicles or drones, identifying cracks based on predefined characteristics.

Crack Classification:
After detecting cracks, the device would classify them according to severity, type, and extent of damage. This classification helps prioritize maintenance actions and assess the overall condition of the pavement network.

Data Analysis and Reporting:
The device would process the collected data and generate comprehensive reports detailing the location, size, and severity of cracks detected. These reports would provide valuable insights for transportation agencies and maintenance crews to make informed decisions.

Maintenance Planning and Scheduling:
Based on the analysis of crack data, the device would recommend maintenance actions such as crack sealing, patching, or resurfacing. It would prioritize repair activities based on factors like crack severity, traffic volume, and available budget.

Decision Support System:
The device would serve as a decision support system for transportation agencies, providing actionable insights and recommendations to optimize pavement maintenance efforts. It would help agencies allocate resources effectively and maximize the lifespan of road infrastructure.

Real-Time Monitoring and Alerts:
The device would continuously monitor pavement conditions in real-time, alerting transportation agencies to newly detected cracks or changes in pavement condition. This proactive approach enables agencies to address emerging issues promptly and prevent further deterioration.

Continuous Improvement and Adaptation:
The device would undergo continuous improvement through feedback mechanisms and algorithm updates. It would adapt to changing environmental conditions, evolving pavement materials, and new technologies to maintain optimal performance over time.</span>
