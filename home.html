                <span class="v8_71">Maintenance Planning:
                    Once cracks are detected and classified, a maintenance planning algorithm is applied to prioritize repair or maintenance actions. This algorithm considers factors such as crack severity, traffic volume, and budget constraints.</span>

                <span class="v8_70">Crack Classification:
                    The detected cracks are classified based on their severity and type. For example, cracks may be categorized as hairline cracks, alligator cracks, or potholes. This classification helps prioritize maintenance actions.</span>

                <span class="v8_69">Feature Extraction:
                    The algorithm extracts relevant features from the images, such as crack length, width, and severity. These features help in characterizing the cracks and assessing their impact on pavement condition.</span>

                <span class="v8_68">Crack Detection Algorithm:
                    A crack detection algorithm is developed to automatically detect cracks in the processed images. This algorithm is trained using machine learning techniques on a dataset of annotated images where cracks are labeled.</span>

                <span class="v8_67">Image Processing:
                    Once the images are collected, they are processed using computer vision techniques. This involves analyzing the images to identify cracks and other signs of pavement deterioration.</span>

                <span class="v8_72">Decision Support System:
                    The system provides recommendations to transportation authority’s or maintenance crews on where and when to perform pavement repairs or preventive maintenance. This information is presented in an easy-to-understand format, such as maps or reports.</span>

                <span class="v8_73">Continuous Improvement:
                    The system is continuously improved by collecting feedback from maintenance activities and updating the detection and planning algorithms accordingly. This iterative process ensures that the system becomes more accurate and effective over time.</span>

                    </span>

                <span class="v8_61">The Automated Pavement Crack Detection and Maintenance Planning Device utilize computer vision algorithms to detect pavement distresses such as cracks. Detected cracks are classified by severity, type, and extent of damage, aiding in maintenance prioritization and network assessment. The system generates detailed reports on crack locations and severity, facilitating informed decision-making for transportation agencies and maintenance crews. Recommendations for maintenance actions are provided based on crack data analysis, considering factors like severity, traffic volume, and budget. It serves as a decision support system, optimizing pavement maintenance efforts and resource allocation. Real-time monitoring alerts agencies to new cracks or changes in pavement condition, enabling prompt action. Continuous improvement mechanisms ensure adaptation to environmental changes and evolving technologies for sustained performance.</span>
